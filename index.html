    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>I was born in a small village called Sin Baw Gaing in Mrauk-U Township, Rakhine State. I completed my primary and middle school education at the local government school in my village. Later, my family moved to Yangon in search of better opportunities. In Yangon, I attended Grade 9 at No. (7) BEHS Insein and completed my high school education (Grade 10) at No. (4) BEHS Mingaladon. Throughout my schooling, which included language studies, sciences, and various extracurricular activities. After graduating from high school, I pursued my interest in Geology at the Department of Geology, Dagon University. My studies focused on rocks, minerals, environments, and other related factors. In the second year of studying geology, the COVID-19 pandemic occurred, and due to various other matters, I was unable to complete my studies.
